synopsis:            Ogma: Helper tool to interoperate between Copilot and other languages.

description:         Ogma is a tool to facilitate the integration of safe runtime monitors into
                     other systems. Ogma extends
                     <https://github.com/Copilot-Language/copilot Copilot>, a high-level runtime
                     verification framework that generates hard real-time C99 code.
                     .
                     Some use cases supported by Ogma include:
                     .
                     - Translating requirements defined in structured natural
                       language into monitors in Copilot.
                     .
                     - Generating the glue code necessary to work with C
                       structs in Copilot.
                     .
                     - Generating
                       <https://cfs.gsfc.nasa.gov/ NASA Core Flight System>
                       applications that use Copilot for monitoring data
                       received from the message bus.
                     .
                     - Generating message handlers for NASA Core Flight System
                       applications to make external data in structs available
                       to a Copilot monitor.
                     .
                     - Generating
                       <https://ros.org Robot Operating System (ROS 2)>
                       applications that use Copilot for monitoring data
                       received from different topics.
                     .
                     - Generating
                       <https://github.com/nasa/fprime F'>
                       components that use Copilot for monitoring.
                     .
                     - Generating monitors from state diagrams specified using
                       a graphical notation.
                     .
                     The main invocation with @--help@ lists sub-commands available.
                     .
