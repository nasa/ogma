** Purpose:
** Coverage Unit Test cases for the SAMPLE Application
**
** Notes:
** This implements various test cases to exercise all code
** paths through all functions defined in the SAMPLE application.
**
** It is primarily focused at providing examples of the various
** stub configurations, hook functions, and wrapper calls that
** are often needed when coercing certain code paths through
** complex functions.
