synopsis:            Ogma: Runtime Monitor translator: XLSX Frontend

description:         Ogma is a tool to facilitate the integration of safe runtime monitors into
                     other systems. Ogma extends
                     <https://github.com/Copilot-Language/copilot Copilot>, a high-level runtime
                     verification framework that generates hard real-time C99 code.
                     .
                     This library contains a frontend to read specs from Excel files.

-- Ogma packages should be uncurated so that only the official maintainers make
-- changes.
--
-- Because this is a NASA project, we want to make sure that users obtain
-- exactly what we publish, unmodified by anyone external to our project.
