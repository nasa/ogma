synopsis:            Ogma: Helper tool to interoperate between Copilot and other languages.

description:         Ogma is a tool to facilitate the integration of safe runtime monitors into
                     other systems. Ogma extends
                     <https://github.com/Copilot-Language/copilot Copilot>, a high-level runtime
                     verification framework that generates hard real-time C99 code.
                     .
                     This package implements the internal commands of ogma.
